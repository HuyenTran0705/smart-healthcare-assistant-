> **A full-stack Smart Healthcare solution integrating a Python-based LLM Voice Assistant with a Flutter Patient Management System.**

##  Introduction
**Smart Healthcare Assistant** is a comprehensive, cross-platform solution designed to modernize elderly care and nursing home operations. This project bridges the gap between AI-driven interaction and efficient medical administration.

This system demonstrates a seamless communication flow between a local **Python backend**, a **web-based visual interface**, and a **Flutter mobile dashboard**.

##  Core Architecture

* **AI Core (Python/Flask):** Leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to power a context-aware Voice Assistant capable of natural Vietnamese conversation.
* **Interactive Frontend (HTML/JS):** Features an animated "Robot Face" UI with Web Speech API integration for seamless voice-to-text and text-to-speech interaction.
* **Management System (Flutter):** A robust cross-platform application for tracking patient records, managing medication schedules (X/O confirmation), and handling administrative tasks via a secure, password-protected gateway.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **AI/Backend:** Python, Flask, OpenAI API (OpenRouter), SpeechRecognition, Pygame.
* **Mobile/Web App:** Flutter, Dart, Firebase (Firestore).
* **Frontend Interface:** HTML5, CSS3 (Animations), JavaScript (Web Speech API).
* **Communication:** RESTful API, WebSocket/Iframe integration.
